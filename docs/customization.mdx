### Customizing the NavbarRouter

NavbarRouter supports three types of Navbar as of today `standard` which is basically material design 2 BottomNavigationBar (default for this package) and `notched` a customized NavigationBar with a notch and a material3 Navbar. User can choose to use either of them by setting the `type` property of the `NavbarRouter` widget to either `NavbarType.standard`, `NavbarType.notched` or `NavbarType.material3`.

#### Standard Navbar

The height of each Navbar can be accessed through the constants `kM3NavbarHeight`
`kStandardNavbarHeight` and `kNotchedNavbarHeight` respectively.


### Decorating the Navbar

The `NavbarDecoration` class is used to customize the standard Navbar, the `NotchedDecoration` class is used to customize the notched Navbar and the `M3NavbarDecoration` class is used to customize the material3 Navbar.
